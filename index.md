#### Why X

When we share a message with our friends, seeing and feeling the reaction on their face means more than just texts, emojis, stickers. It's human nature to sense these emotions, but it doesn’t exist in any current messenger apps.

That’s why I want to make a new behavioral paradigm in social apps that make people connected emotionally.
