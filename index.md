### Mission

Our mission is to build a social network that empowers people to create real emotional connections with friends in animated identities.

### Why X

When we share a message with our friends, seeing and feeling the reaction on their face means more than just texts, emojis, stickers. It's human nature to sense these emotions, but it doesn’t exist in any current messenger apps.

Human connections in the current messaging apps are getting cheaper and cheaper. The medium makes you feel the text and emoji are to easy to send. I have been suffering from this for years. That’s why I want to make a new UI paradigm in social apps that make people connected emotionally.
