### A Git-powered Knowledge Base Network

[Stage2: launch on 8/15]

To solve the scattered knowledge graph problem in the current web, we need the good knolwedge input system (the search engine) and a well-structured network (interactions).

I believe:

- Knowledge should be structured and organized
- The key to having a valuable knowledge ecosystem is **the interaction with a knowledge system that provides value**, so more knowledgable people will join.

The core interaction on TARS is to **iterate Knowledge branching with other hackers**:

- Search network-driven knowledge
- Create / join a mission to iterate the knowledge together
- Clone other people's knowledge base to a local computer
- Annotate and comment on it then **Push** it back to the network
- Other users can choose to **Pull** the update to their branch
- **Merge** different knowledge base

### The Operating System for Human Knowldege

Vision In 5 Years:

We decentralize our knowledge and intelligence to a network with a customizable personal knowledge AI, so we can digest and iterate knowledge faster, deeper.

### Why Me?

I'm a heavy user of the personal knowledge base. I have been iterating my own [knowledge base](https://github.com/allenleein/knowledge-base) on Github for 2 years. I have 281 stars and 30 forks on my knowledge base. One of my post from knowledge base got on **front page of Hacker News and got 16K+ page views** in 2 days.
