### Earned Secrets


**Intro:**

[Pensieve]() is an iOS search app that extracts the details of screenshots like text, links, locations, and makes it searchable and clickable. We make your static digital memories interactable. 


**Table of Contents:**

1. Traction (user,customomers,revenue)
2. Insights
3. How do i get it
4. Insights to inspiration
5. Unfair advantage

### Traction

No revenue, user.

(Just shifted to build the iOS app first a week ago. I have 5 private beta users on the previous desktop version)

### Insights 

> Some people on Github love to follow the update of my digital memories project (screenshots, pdfs, audios...), and clone it to their account.

> My digital memories's staring-forking ratio is as high as the most popular repos on Github.

### How do i get it

I started my '[digital brain]((https://github.com/allenleein/knowledge-base))' project on Github 2 Years Ago, without any promotion, people there:

1. Love to clone my project and follow the updates
2. [Thank me](https://imgur.com/a/PiVlCoW) for easy to navigate folders and files of my project
3. Tell me they love my original project idea: 'decentralize my brain to a network of brains’.



### Insights to inspiration

These under discovered behaviors that indicate I might have a chance to build a niche social network of digital memories on top of it.  

So, why building a tool to serve the discovery needs first? Because without a search engine with OCR, Computer Vision, it takes 100x more time to discover the the right part of information in screenshots, pdfs, audio, video. Without the discovery features, It's hard to reduce the social discovery friction at scale.

So, in order to create the initial product momentum, I start from screenshots discovery, then expand to other file formats I mentioned above.

**Interesting numbers:**

> My project's staring-forking ratio is as high as the most popular repos on Github.
 
My project: +13% (the most 5 popular repo on Github: +13.8%)

 ( Staring-forking ratio: for every 10 people who star a project, at least 1 of them will clone it to their account)

### Unfair advantage


**Distribution**

> An existing niche distribution that I can leverage the community and expand from there

Except people who DM/Cold email me, my project [got recommended]((https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/other/wiki-workflow#similar-wikis-i-liked)) by a popular open source knowledge community leader on his list of favorite knowledge wikis.

The other knowledge wiki owners on the list and their followers are my targeted early user since they are maintaining a digital memories, knowledge base project like myslef. 

I will leverage the niche community of knowledge base users first, then expand it to more broad user base. 

I cold reached 10 people from the community for my idea, they all signed up the waiting list.



### Why Now

Screenshots in people's phone are the most underdiscovered personal memories other than photos, also is the hardest media to discover.


### What's Special

We are creating another media interface layer by making the static media files like screenshots, pdfs interactively alive. For examples, you can screenshots the screen while you listen to a Podcast episode as a bookmark, same when you saving Instagram photos for wish list ideas. We also plan to design the next standard of interactive pdf format, which is including animation, videos, Flash (Demo).
