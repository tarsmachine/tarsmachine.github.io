### How We Think and Operate

**Exponential Value, Not Valuation**

The question we ask ourselves on every product decision is ‘Would this lead to a 10X-100X increase in the value of our product’ Then we focus on it. We don’t talk or promote anything related to the company valuation, funding news.


**Evaluate and Execute**

- Pursue the highest upside first, calculate the resources to make it happen later.
- Pursue 100% clarity of thinking.
- Find the secrets that would help us win faster and bigger. (solving the picture of the puzzle faster, not putting the pieces together faster)



### We Aim to Change the Game Completely

Most product and distribution roadmaps are incremental. Do x, then y, then z, each of which has a linear increase in the value of the product or company. In our way, we get out of that way of thinking and ask what sorts of strategies, adoptions, or designs would completely change the game for the company.

For us, building product is a “user experience and liquidity” problem, and the goal is to make the product experience so good that enable us to scale without spending a fortune on sales and marketing. Taking advantage of a market insight or new platform before an incumbent is able to react. That’s why we deliver MDP (Most Desirable Product), not MVP.

### Unpopular Minds Create Unpopular Ideas

[We're looking for design and engineering generalists](mailto:allen@readyplayerx.com) who are obsessed with unpopular thinking. You will be critical in setting the product vision and defining the team culture. We’re reserving a large chunk of equity so that our team feels like a true owner and co-creator of this company.
