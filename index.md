### Insights from Building A 'Digital Brain' on Github for 2 Years 

> Some people on Github love to follow the update of my digital memories project (screenshots, pdfs, audios...), and clone it to their account.


I started my '[digital brain](https://github.com/allenleein/knowledge-base)' project on Github 2 Years Ago, without any promotion, people there:

1. Love to clone my project and follow the updates
2. [Thank me](https://imgur.com/a/PiVlCoW) for organizing and sharing my knowledge inputs regularly.
3. Tell me they love my original project idea: 'decentralize my brain to a network of brainsâ€™

The staring-forking ratio of my project is as high as the most popular repos on Github.
  
> My project: +13% vs. Top 5 popular repo on Github: +13.8%

*Starig-forking ratio: for every 10 people who star a project, at least 1 of them will clone it to their account

### Insights to Inspiration

These insights inspired me to build a niche social network of digital memories on top of my current followers.  

**Why building a search engine to serve the personal discovery needs first**

First, the screenshots in people's phones are the most under-discovered personal memories, also the hardest media to discover. 

Second, a social app without the OCR, Computer Vision features in the search engine will take the user 100x more time to discover and extract the right part of the information in screenshots. Without the discovery features, It's also hard to reduce the friction of social discovery at scale.

Therefore, to create the initial product momentum, I start from screenshots discovery. I will expand to other file formats after reach PMF.

**New media format**

In the longterm, I want to create a new media interface layer by making the static media files like screenshots, pdfs interactively alive. For example, you can screenshot the screen while you listen to a podcast episode as a bookmark and share it with friends, then your friend can listen to the episode with the timestamp just by clicking the screenshot in our app.

### An Existing Niche Distribution

Except for my own followers, my project [got recommended]((https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/other/wiki-workflow#similar-wikis-i-liked)) by a popular open-source knowledge community leader on his list of favorite knowledge wikis.

The other knowledge wiki owners on the list and their followers are my targeted early user since they are maintaining or following the digital memory, knowledgebase projects like myself. 

I will leverage the niche community of knowledge base users first, then expand it to a more broad user base.
