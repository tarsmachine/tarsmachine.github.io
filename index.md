### Insights from Building A 'Digital Brain' on Github for 2 Years 

> Some people on Github love to follow the update of my digital memories project (screenshots, pdfs, audios...), and clone it to their account.


I started my '[digital brain](https://github.com/allenleein/knowledge-base)' project on Github 2 years ago. Without any promotion, people there:

1. Love to clone my project and follow the updates
2. [Thank me](https://imgur.com/a/PiVlCoW) for organizing and sharing my knowledge inputs regularly.
3. Like the way I search the whole project in terminal
3. Love my original project idea: 'decentralize my brain to a network of brainsâ€™

The staring-forking ratio of my project is as high as the most popular repos on Github.
  
> My project: +13%
> Top 5 popular repo on Github: +13.8%

### Insights to Inspiration

These insights inspired me to build a niche social network of digital memories like screenshots, PDFs on top of my current followers.  

**Why building a search engine for personal screenshots discovery first?**

First, the screenshots in people's phones are the most under-discovered personal memories, also one of the hardest media formats to discover. 

Second, a social app for screenshots without the OCR, Computer Vision features in the search engine will take the user 100x more time to discover and extract the right part of the information. Without the discovery features, It's also hard to reduce the friction of social discovery at scale.

Therefore, to create the initial product momentum, I focus on building an app for personal screenshots discovery first.

### An Existing Niche Distribution

Except for my own followers, my project [got recommended](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/other/wiki-workflow#similar-wikis-i-liked) by a popular open-source knowledge community leader on his list of favorite knowledge wikis.

The other knowledge wiki owners on the list and their followers are my targeted early user since they are maintaining or following the digital memory, knowledgebase projects like myself. 

I will leverage the niche community of knowledge base users first, then expand it to a more broad user base.
