**Intro:**

We make your static digital memories interactable. 

[Pensieve]() is an iOS search app that extracts the details of screenshots like text, links, locations, and makes it searchable and clickable.

### Zero Traction

- Revenue, user: 0
- Pre-everything: launch, user, rev, incorporation
- Building iOS beta. Beta Launch: Mid-Sep

(I just decided to build the iOS app first. Before that, I have 5 users on the [macOS private beta]())

### Insights from Building A 'Digital Brain' on Github for 2 Years 

> Some people on Github love to follow the update of my digital memories project (screenshots, pdfs, audios...), and clone it to their account.


I started my '[digital brain](https://github.com/allenleein/knowledge-base)' project on Github 2 Years Ago, without any promotion, people there:

1. Love to clone my project and follow the updates
2. [Thank me](https://imgur.com/a/PiVlCoW) for easy to navigate folders and files of my project
3. Tell me they love my original project idea: 'decentralize my brain to a network of brainsâ€™

> The staring-forking ratio of my project is as high as the most popular repos on Github
>  
> My project: +13% vs. Top 5 popular repo on Github: +13.8%

*Starig-forking ratio: for every 10 people who star a project, at least 1 of them will clone it to their account



### Insights to Inspiration

These insights inspired me to build a niche social network of digital memories on top of my current followers.  

Why building a search engine to serve the discovery needs first? Because a social app without the OCR, Computer Vision features in the search engine, it will take a user 100x more time to discover and extract the right part of the information in screenshots. Without the discovery features, It's also hard to reduce the friction of social discovery at scale.

Therefore, to create the initial product momentum, I start from screenshots discovery, then will expand to other file formats I mentioned above in the future.

### An Existing Niche Distribution

Except for my own followers, my project [got recommended]((https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/other/wiki-workflow#similar-wikis-i-liked)) by a popular open-source knowledge community leader on his list of favorite knowledge wikis.

The other knowledge wiki owners on the list and their followers are my targeted early user since they are maintaining digital memory, knowledgebase project like myself. 

I will leverage the niche community of knowledge base users first, then expand it to a more broad user base.
