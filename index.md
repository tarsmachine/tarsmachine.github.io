### TARS

## Empowers humans to explore and iterate knowledge faster

**Why TARS:**

<img src="images/infovknowledge.png" alt="sample image">

> Knowledge become unstructured and mixed with ads and content spams on web

Solution:

> Stage1: A search engine for personal knowledge base

> Stage2: A git-powered knowledge network

> Stage3: An operating system for knowledge

### A Search Engine for Hacker's Minds

**Launch: 7/15**

- You need to have a knowledge base (blogs, personal wiki...) to join the network
- Browse knowledge base list to clone
- Search network-driven knowledge without noise and spam


Desktop Demo:

**[Join Private Beta (Win/OSX/Ubuntu)](http://app.tarsmachine.com/)**

### A Git-powered Knowledge Network

**Launch: 8/15**


I believe:

1. The key to having a valuable knowledge ecosystem is the interaction with a knowledge system that provides value, so more people will contribute the input and output. An engaging medium for knowledge.

2. An engaging medium for knowledge is one which brings the reader into active conversation with the material. It is a medium which encourages the reader to think, make, or act, beyond mindlessly consuming material.

Therefore, the core interaction on TARS is to iterate knowledge branching with other hackers:

- Search network-driven knowledge
- Create / join a mission to iterate the knowledge together
- Clone other people's knowledge base to a local computer
- Edit (Annotate, comment...) on it then **Push** it back to the network
- Other users can choose to **Pull** the update to their branch
- **Merge** different knowledge base

### The Operating System for Human Knowldege

**Vision In 5 Years**

We decentralize our knowledge to a network with a customizable personal knowledge AI, so we can collaboratively iterate knowledge faster.


---

### The Master Plan

1. Build a search engine for network-driven knowledge
2. The users iterate knowledge with other knowledge branch owners in the network
3. Build an efficient machine learning data pipeline on top of the structured knowledge input & output system 
4. Use the unique data to train the customizable personal knowledge AI

### Why Me?

I'm a heavy user of the personal knowledge base. I have been iterating my own [knowledge base](https://github.com/allenleein/knowledge-base) on Github for 2 years.

One of my post from knowledge base got on **front page of Hacker News and got 16K+ page views** in 2 days.
