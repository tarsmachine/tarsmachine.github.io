**Intro:**

[Pensieve]() is an iOS search app that extracts the details of screenshots like text, links, locations, and makes it searchable and clickable. 

We make your static digital memories interactable.

### Zero Traction

- Revenue, user: 0
- Pre-everything: launch, user, rev, incorporation
- Building iOS beta. Beta Launch: Mid-Sep

(I just decided to build the iOS app first. Before that, I have 5 users on the [macOS private beta]())

### Insights from Building A 'Digital Brain' on Github for 2 Years 

> Some people on Github love to follow the update of my digital memories project (screenshots, pdfs, audios...), and clone it to their account.

> My digital memories's staring-forking ratio is as high as the most popular repos on Github.

I started my '[digital brain](https://github.com/allenleein/knowledge-base)' project on Github 2 Years Ago, without any promotion, people there:

1. Love to clone my project and follow the updates
2. [Thank me](https://imgur.com/a/PiVlCoW) for easy to navigate folders and files of my project
3. Tell me they love my original project idea: 'decentralize my brain to a network of brains’

> 'My project's staring-forking ratio is as high as the most popular repos on Github
>  
> My project: +13% 
> The most popular repo on Github: +13.8%

*Staring-forking ratio: for every 10 people who star a project, at least 1 of them will clone it to their account



### Insights to inspiration

These under-discovered behaviors that indicate I might have a chance to build a niche social network of digital memories on top of my current followers.  

So, why building a tool to serve the discovery needs first? Because without a search engine with OCR, Computer Vision, it will take a user 100x more time to discover the right part of the information in screenshots, pdfs, audio, video. Without the discovery features, It's also hard to reduce the social discovery friction at scale.

So, to create the initial product momentum, I start from screenshots discovery, then expand to other file formats I mentioned above.

### Unfair advantage


**Distribution**

> An existing niche distribution that I can leverage the community and expand from there

Except for people who DM/Cold email me, my project [got recommended]((https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/other/wiki-workflow#similar-wikis-i-liked)) by a popular open-source knowledge community leader on his list of favorite knowledge wikis.

The other knowledge wiki owners on the list and their followers are my targeted early user since they are maintaining digital memory, knowledgebase project like myself. 

I will leverage the niche community of knowledge base users first, then expand it to a more broad user base. 



### Why Now

Screenshots in people's phones are the most under-discovered personal memories other than photos, also are the hardest media to discover. 


### What's the Future

We are creating another media interface layer by making the static media files like screenshots, pdfs interactively alive. For example, you can screenshot the screen while you listen to a podcast episode as a bookmark and share it with friends, then your friend can listen to the episode with the timestamp just by clicking the screenshot.

We also plan to design the next standard of interactive pdf format, which is including animation, videos, and Flash in a PDF (Demo).
