**Mission**

Our mission is to build a social network that empowers people to create real emotional connections with friends in animated identities.

**Things Everyone Else Is Missing**

When we share a message with our friends, seeing and feeling the reaction on their face means more than just texts, emojis, stickers. It's human nature to sense these emotions, but it doesnâ€™t exist in any current messenger apps.

**Why Now**

Tech Shift

X benefiting from a massive fundamental camera tech shift: Truth depth camera on iOS. The tech presents a new camera-based content creation possibility and empowers us to build it on X.

### The Master Plan

- Build a search engine that extracts the details from screenshots, and makes it searchable and clickable

- Invent a new way people interact with static media (Photo, PDF...)

- Build a private social network for personal digital memories
