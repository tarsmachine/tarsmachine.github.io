### TARS

## Empowers humans to explore and iterate knowledge faster

**Why:**

> Knowledge searching on web become unstructured and mixed with ads and content spams

**Plan:**

> Stage1: A search engine for personal knowledge base

> Stage2: A collaborative knowledge network

> Stage3: An operating system for knowledge

---

### A Search Engine for Personal Knowledge Base

- A customizable-input search engine
- Search without any ads and spams

**[Request Access (Win/OSX/Ubuntu)](mailto:allenleein@gmail.com?subject=Join TARS&body=Hi, I would like to join the private beta! I'm on [Win/OSX/Linux].)**


---

### A Collaborative Knowledge Network

- A medium which encourages the users to think, make, or act, beyond mindlessly consuming knowledge

- Git-powered ([Example](https://github.com/allenleein/knowledge-base))

The core interaction on TARS is to iterate knowledge branching with other people:

- Clone a knowledge branch 
- Edit (Annotate, comment...) on it then **Push** it back to the network
- The branch owner / other users can choose to **Pull** the update to their branch
- **Merge** different knowledge branch

### The Operating System for Human Knowldege

**Vision In 10 Years**

We upload our knowledge to a network with a customizable personal knowledge AI, so we can collaboratively iterate knowledge faster.


---

### The Master Plan

1. Build a search engine for network-driven knowledge
2. The users iterate knowledge with other knowledge branch owners in the network
3. Build an efficient machine learning data pipeline on top of the structured knowledge input & output system 
4. Use the unique data to train the customizable personal knowledge AI

### Why Me?

I'm a heavy user of the personal knowledge base. I have been iterating my own [knowledge base](https://github.com/allenleein/knowledge-base) on Github for 2 years.

One of my post from knowledge base got on **front page of Hacker News and got 16K+ page views** in 2 days.
